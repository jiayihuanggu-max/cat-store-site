      <h3>Enrichment</h3>
      <p><strong>Scratching posts and cat trees:</strong> These provide a natural place for cats to scratch, trim their claws, and serve as a jungle gym for exercise and napping.</p>
      <p><strong>Toys:</strong> Keep your cat mentally stimulated and physically active with a variety of toys, such as puzzle toys, feather toys, and interactive toys like a laser pointer or a feather wand. </p>

      <p><strong>Cat-proofing:</strong> Cat-proof your home by hiding electrical cords, securing breakable items, closing toilet lids, and putting human food away.</p>
      <p><strong>ID Tag:</strong> Even for indoor cats, provide a collar with an ID tag including your phone number. </p>
